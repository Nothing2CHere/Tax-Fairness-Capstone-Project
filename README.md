# Tax-Fairness-Capstone-Project

1.	What is the problem you want to solve
Improve unfairness or inequality in the Federal tax code.
•	Option 1 - Capture how problem has been getting worse over time.
•	Option 2 – Capture how problem is distributed by location or state & zip code

2.	Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
Clients:  American tax payers and Government tax policy officials.
Desired client reactions:  create a call to action for fairness and equality in our federal tax code.  Also have a national discussion on how we define fairness and equality in our tax code.


3.	What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
Sources:  IRS website on Individual Income Tax return data
Gross number sanity checks:  Tax Policy Center (TPC) which claims to be non-partison.
Overall revenue perspective (how much does inequality or lack of fairness) impact our overall Federal revenue:  usgovernmentrevenue.com


4.	In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

    1.	Pull data from websites.  Construct data frames.
    2.	Construct a few metrics that capture unfairness:  effective tax rate, total tax deductions & tax credits by gross income levels.
    3.	Create many charts, figure out best charts to tell a story
    4.	Tell the story
    5.	Capture story accuracy limitations
    6.	Capture possible future work.

5.	What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

    1.	Data scrapping code.
    2.	Code for data frame construction and manipulation, metric execution and charting.
    3.	Machine learning prediction of the future up through 2020.
    4.	Paper & slide deck with best charts selected and annotated.  Data story constructed.
